- ✅ Standardized all shopId fields to use numbers consistently
- ✅ Added comprehensive database indexes for performance
- ✅ Fixed data type inconsistencies across collections

### 4. **Development Setup Improvements**

- ✅ Fixed dev dependencies (added @types/bcryptjs)
- ✅ Improved project structure and organization

### 5. **Setup Wizard Enhancement**
- ✅ Created new setup wizard component (`app/setup/SetupWizard.tsx`)
- ✅ Multi-step onboarding process
- ✅ Integration configuration during setup

## 🔧 **Files Created/Modified**

### New Files:
- `.env.template` - Environment variables template
- `lib/env.ts` - Environment validation utility
- `scripts/migrate-shopid-to-numbers.ts` - Database migration script
- `app/setup/SetupWizard.tsx` - Enhanced setup wizard

### Modified Files:
- `package.json` - Removed NextAuth, added scripts and types
- `middleware.ts` - Enhanced with proper session validation
- `lib/auth.ts` - Added environment validation
- `app/setup/page.tsx` - Updated to use new wizard

## 🚀 **Next Steps (Phase 2)**

To continue improving the application, the next phase should focus on:

1. **Core SaaS Features**
   - Stripe integration for billing
   - Subscription management
   - Usage tracking and limits
   - Pricing tiers implementation

2. **User Experience**
   - Improved onboarding flow
   - Better error handling and user feedback
   - Email notifications and confirmations

3. **Admin Panel**
   - Customer management interface
   - Usage analytics and reporting
   - Billing management dashboard

## ⚠️ **Known Issues to Address**

1. **TypeScript Configuration**: Some React/Next.js types are not properly configured
2. **Email Service**: Need to implement actual email sending for password reset
3. **Testing**: No test suite currently exists
4. **Error Logging**: Need proper error tracking (Sentry integration)

## 📋 **To Run Migration**

1. Copy environment template:
   ```bash
   npm run setup:dev
   ```

2. Edit `.env.local` with your actual values

3. Run database migration:
   ```bash
   npm run migrate:shopid
   ```

## 🔒 **Security Improvements Made**

- Session validation now hits database for security
- Invalid sessions are properly cleared
- Environment variable validation prevents runtime errors
- Password hashing standardized with bcrypt
- Proper error handling without information leakage

## 📊 **Performance Improvements**

- Added comprehensive database indexes
- Optimized session validation queries
- Standardized data types for better query performance
- Connection pooling for MongoDB
